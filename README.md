 1.The goal of the project is creating a File-type Identification tool which can classify an object 
 after seeing an object of the same class a few times or even once (One-Shot).
 
File-type Identification is the task of assigning a predefined label (the file type) to each instance (each file) based on observed data in the file.
One-Shot File-type Identification is a method in which the classifier can assign every file it's predefined label
after "seeing" the same type of file a few times or only once.
